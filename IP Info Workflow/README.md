# IP Information Workflow
## How to get Started?
First, generate an API key at https://ipinfo.io
You can do this for **free** for 50k IP Queries a month. 
If you need additional, I recommend purchasing one of their plans.

Import this file into Rewst, and setup the Triggers and Integration as follows.

### Integration Setup:
Use the Custom Integration option inside of Rewst with the information below:\
Hostname: ipinfo.io\
Authentication Method: API Key\
API Key: Enter in your API Key Here\
API Key Header Name: Authorization\
API Key Preamble: Bearer

### Workflow Setup:
All you need to do is just setup the Integration override on the IP Lookup Integration.
