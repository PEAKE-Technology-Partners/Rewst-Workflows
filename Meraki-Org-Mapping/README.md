This Workflow Allows you to map the Rewst Org Variable _Meraki_Org_ID_ to a Specific Meraki Org Name.

Assumptions:
Meraki Org Name is in the Rewst Org Name. They can both be Identical, or the Meraki Org Name can be inside of the Rewst Org Name.
Any Orgs that don't match can be manually assigned. You can choose how to get the list of unmatched orgs, but that can be done through something like an Email or Slack Message, or Ticket Note.

This Meraki Org ID, allows you to skip a Step in Future workflows and go stright to doing whatever you wanted to do with the Org.
